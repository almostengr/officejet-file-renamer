# OfficeJet File Renamer

A utility built to rename image files that were scanned using HP OfficeJet scanner. 

## Purpose

The purpose of the project was to rename files that were scanned using the HP OfficeJet scanner 
that I had at the time. 

The scanner did not have double sided scanning. So I wrote this application that would allow me to 
scan the front side of a stack of documents. Then turn the entire stack over and scan the backside 
of the stack of documents. Then this application would rename the files so that they were in the 
order of page 1 front, page 1 back, page 2 front, page 2 back, and so on.
